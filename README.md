# Economy-Bot
This bot was made on Replit, it won't work in the latest Discord.js version. I abandoned the project some time ago due to my server being deleted (there was no activity). If you wanna use the project using Discord.js V12, you will have to do some changes or it will probably not work. Gl!

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you will have to download NPM and Node because they are the base of the project, I would recommend you to use Replit tho.
